    "| ![portrait of Newton](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Portrait_of_Sir_Isaac_Newton%2C_1689_%28brightened%29.jpg) | Newton saw calculus as the algebraic analogue of arithmetic with infinite decimals, and he wrote in his Tractatus de Methodis Serierum et Fluxionum (1671; “Treatise on the Method of Series and Fluxions”): <br> <br> *I am amazed that it has occurred to no one (if you except N. Mercator and his quadrature of the hyperbola) to fit the doctrine recently established for decimal numbers to variables, especially since the way is then open to more striking consequences. For since this doctrine in species has the same relationship to Algebra that the doctrine of decimal numbers has to common Arithmetic, its operations of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Root extraction may be easily learnt from the latter’s.*  <br> <br> Refererence: [Britanica encyclopedia](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Newton-and-Infinite-Series-1368282) |\n",
